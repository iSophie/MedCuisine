            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Data Server user interface provides access to data server functionality. It allows
                administrators to view the dashboard and see the status of the jobs and system details. 
                Administrators can manage information about servers and conduct various configurations on the system and application
                settings.

            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator helps you manage global assets common to the distributed infrastructure
                behind IBM StoredIQ applications.
            </p>

            <img class="image" />
            <p class="p">IBM StoredIQ Administrator provides at-a-glance understanding of the different issues that can crop up
                in the IBM StoredIQ environment. These views are unique to the IBM StoredIQ Administrator application
                as they provide an overview of how the system is running. They allow access to various pieces of
                information that are being shared across applications or allow for the management of resources in a
                centralized manner.</p>

            <p class="p">The administrator is the person responsible for managing the IBM StoredIQ. This individual has strong
                understanding of data sources, indexes, data servers, jobs, infosets, and actions. This list provides an
                overview as to how IBM StoredIQ Administrator works:</p>

            
            <ul class="ul">
                <li class="li"><p class="p">
                    <strong class="ph b">Viewing data servers and volumes: </strong>Using IBM StoredIQ Administrator, the Administrator can identify
                    what data servers are deployed, their location, what data is being managed, and the status of each data
                    server in the system. Volume management is a central component of IBM StoredIQ. IBM StoredIQ
                    Administrator also allows the Administrator to see what volumes are currently under management,
                    which data server is responsible for that volume, the state of the volume after indexing, and the amount
                    and size of information that is contained by each volume. Administrators can also add volumes to and
                    delete volumes from data servers through this interface.
                </p>

                
                    <p class="p">If IBM StoredIQ is configured for integration with Information Governance Catalog, the Administrator
                        can also manage which volumes are published to the governance catalog.</p>
